crazyflie_ros
=============

ROS stack for Bitcraze Crazyflie (http://www.bitcraze.se/), with the following features:

* Support for Crazyflie 1.0 and Crazyflie 2.0 (using stock firmware)
* Publishes on-board sensors in ROS standard message formats
* Supports ROS parameters to reconfigure crazyflie parameters
* Support for using multiple Crazyflies with a single Crazyradio
* Includes external controller for waypoint navigation (if motion capture system is available)
* No dependency to the Bitcraze SDK (Driver and Controller written in C++)

A tutorial (for a slightly older version) is available in W. HÃ¶nig and N. Ayanian. "Flying Multiple UAVs Using ROS", Chapter in Robot Operating System (ROS): The Complete Reference (Volume 2), Springer, 2017. (see http://act.usc.edu/publications.html for a free pre-print).

If you want to control many Crazyflies or look for a good controller for a single Crazyflie, take a look at http://crazyswarm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. We are currently in the process to unify the Crazyswarm and crazyflie_ros as well as contributing the Crazyswarm firmware changes back to the official firmware.

## Installation

Clone the package into your catkin workspace:
```
git clone https://github.com/lucasromary/crazyflie_ros_hexa.git

```

Use `catkin_make` on your workspace to compile.

## Usage

There are six packages included: crazyflie_cpp, crazyflie_driver, crazyflie_tools, crazyflie_description, crazyflie_controller, and crazyflie_demo.
Note that the below description might be slightly out-of-date, as we continue merging the Crazyswarm and crazyflie_ros.

### Crazyflie_Cpp

This package contains a cpp library for the Crazyradio and Crazyflie. It can be used independently of ROS.

### Crazyflie_driver

This package contains the driver. In order to support multiple Crazyflies with a single Crazyradio, there is crazyflie_server (communicating with all Crazyflies) and crazyflie_add to dynamically add Crazyflies.
The server does not communicate to any Crazyflie initially, hence crazyflie_add needs to be used.

### Crazyflie_tools

This package contains tools which are helpful, but not required for normal operation. So far, it just support one tool for scanning for a Crazyflie.

You can find connected Crazyflies using:
```
rosrun crazyflie_tools scan
```

### Crazyflie_description

This package contains a 3D model of the Crazyflie (1.0). This is for visualization purposes in rviz.

### Crazyflie_controller

This package contains a simple PID controller for hovering or waypoint navigation.
It can be used with external motion capture systems, such as VICON.

### Crazyflie_demo

This package contains a rich set of examples to get quickly started with the Crazyflie.

For controlling each motor with a pwm value (0 to 65536):
```
roslaunch crazyflie_demo crazyhexa_pwm m1:=3000 m2:=3000 m3:=3000 m4:=3000 m5:=3000 m6:=3000
```
where you can change the value of each motor (m1 to m6).

This is also possible on a quadrotor crazyflie :
```
roslaunch crazyflie_demo crazyhexa_pwm m1:=3000 m2:=3000 m3:=3000 m4:=3000
```

## ROS Features

### Parameters

The launch file supports the following arguments:
* uri: Specifier for the crazyflie, e.g. radio://0/80/2M
* tf_prefix: tf prefix for the crazyflie frame(s)
* roll_trim: Trim in degrees, e.g. negative if flie drifts to the left
* pitch_trim: Trim in degrees, e.g. negative if flie drifts forward

See http://wiki.bitcraze.se/projects:crazyflie:userguide:tips_and_tricks for details on how to obtain good trim values.

### Subscribers

#### cmd_vel

Similar to the hector_quadrotor, package the fields are used as following:
* linear.y: roll [e.g. -30 to 30 degrees]
* linear.x: pitch [e.g. -30 to 30 degrees]
* angular.z: yawrate [e.g. -200 to 200 degrees/second]
* linear.z: thrust [10000 to 60000 (mapped to PWM output)]

### Publishers

#### imu
* sensor_msgs/IMU
* contains the sensor readings of gyroscope and accelerometer
* The covariance matrices are set to unknown
* orientation is not set (this could be done by the magnetometer readings in the future.)
* update: 10ms (time between crazyflie and ROS not synchronized!)
* can be viewed in rviz

#### temperature
* sensor_msgs/Temperature
* From Barometer (10DOF version only) in degree Celcius (Sensor readings might be higher than expected because the PCB warms up; see http://www.bitcraze.se/2014/02/logging-and-parameter-frameworks-turtorial/)
* update: 100ms (time between crazyflie and ROS not synchronized!)

#### magnetic_field
* sensor_msgs/MagneticField
* update: 100ms (time between crazyflie and ROS not synchronized!)

#### pressure
